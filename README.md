# Hello World!
## This is my first markdown file
   My name is Gregory, and I'm learning to code at Code Immersives!  
     I'm from Louisville Kentucky and I'm a self taught coder. I've been coding for about one year using free sources on the web.
       My favorite sources are:  
  1. [W3schools](w3shools.com)
  2. [Freecodecamp](freecodecamp.com)
  3. [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com)
  
    
      
      ## My Hobbies include:  
      * Photography ([Instagram here](https://www.instagram.com/greg_wit_da_camera/))
      * Breakging ([video here](https://youtu.be/qy6svuJGYrY?t=176))
      * making beats on my sampler for fun ([some terrible music with awful audio quality](https://photos.app.goo.gl/JE1xd39fqrtLvBa68))
